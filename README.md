# Basic Git Scraper Template

The template used template provides a starting point for **git scraping**â€”the technique of scraping data from websites and automatically committing it to a Git repository using workflows, [coined by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/).

## Overview

The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/scrape.yaml` runs on a defined schedule to:

1. Checkout the code
2. Set up the Python environment
3. Install dependencies via Pipenv
4. Run the python script `script.py` to scrape data
5. Commit any updated data files to the Git repository

## Scheduling

The workflow schedule is configured with [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run:

- Every day at 8PM UTC

This once-daily scraping is a good rule-of-thumb, as it is generally respectful of the target website, as it does not contribute to any measurable burden to the site's resources.

You can use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to generate your own cron schedule.

## Python Libraries

The main libraries used are:

- [`bs4`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
- [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Making HTTP requests to scrape web pages
- - [`selenium`](https://www.selenium.dev/) - Interacting with dynamically loaded web pages and running a headless browser for JavaScript-rendered content  
- [`loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) - Logging errors and run info
- [`pytz`](https://github.com/stub42/pytz) - Handling datetimes and timezones  
- [`waybackpy`](https://github.com/akamhy/waybackpy/) - Scraping web archives (optional)

8. Validate quality of scraped data, and recognize limitations in ensuring relevance and accuracy inherent with web data.  

9. Document your scraping process thoroughly for replicability, transparency and accountability.

10. Continuously re-evaluate your scraping program against applicable laws and ethical principles.
